# node-fdm Documentation

`node-fdm` is a physics-guided Neural ODE framework for vertical flight dynamics. The OpenSky 2025 pipeline included here lets you reproduce the ADS-B study end-to-end: build an aircraft list, download Mode S data, preprocess + enrich with ERA5, train Neural ODEs per aircraft type, and benchmark against BADA.

Use this site as a quick reference:
- **Guide**: install and run the OpenSky 2025 pipeline locally.
- **How-to**: focused recipes (training, inference, configuration).
- **Concepts**: model inputs/outputs and column groups.
- **Reference API**: auto-generated mkdocstrings for the package.

If you only need a fast start, jump to `Guide → Quickstart`.
