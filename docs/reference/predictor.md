# 🔮 Predictor API

The `NodeFDMPredictor` serves as the **inference engine** for the framework.

It is responsible for loading trained model artifacts (checkpoints and metadata), reconstructing the specific neural architecture, and performing full trajectory rollouts (simulations) by integrating the learned dynamics over time.
